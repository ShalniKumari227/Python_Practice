E. Reverse the string.

3.Question: If you have a string sentence = "This is a long sentence.", how would you extract the word "long" using slicing?

4.Question: Write a Python program that takes a string as input and prints each character of the string on a new line using a for loop.

5.Question: Modify the program in question 4 to also print the index of each character alongside the character.

6.Question: You have the variables product = "Laptop" and price = 60,000. Use an f-string to print the following sentence: "The Laptop costs 60,000."

7.Question: Given the variables name = "vikas" and score = 85, use an f-string to print: "vikas's score is 85."

8.Question: Using the .format() method, create the same output as in Question 6: "The Laptop costs 60,000."

9.Question: Write a Python program that takes a string as input and uses the enumerate() function to print each character along with its index.

10.Question: Write a Python program that takes a string as input and uses the range() function along with a for loop to print each character of the string in reverse order of their index.
